## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
+My software is a vehicle service management portal that aims to address operational issues for more visibility for vehicle owners, accountability from the mechanic to the client and save the client money through transparency thus inhibiting cost inflation by car service personnel.
+These problems are significant because they address key issues that are pain points to vehicle owners which lead to substandars work and in the long run leaves vehicle owners frustrated.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
1. Prevents Wasted Effort & Scope Creep by a precise problem statement distinguishing between core needs and "nice-to-haves."
  -Example: If users struggle with slow invoice processing (the real problem), building a fancy UI won’t help.Optimizing backend workflows will.
  -This saves time/money by avoiding features that don’t address the root issue.
2. Guides Solution Design:a well-defined problem reveals constraints (e.g., "Must work offline for field agents").
  -Example: A farming app needing offline sync dictates database architecture (e.g., SQLite vs. Firebase).
  -Technical decisions align with actual user needs, not assumptions.
3. Enables Measurable Success:a clear problem includes success metrics (e.g., "Reduce support tickets by 30%").
  -Example: If the problem is "Users abandon carts due to complex checkout," success = shorter checkout steps → higher conversions.
  -This lets teams validate solutions quantitatively, not just gut feelings.
4. Improves Stakeholder Alignment:A shared problem definition unites teams (devs, designers, execs) around a goal.
  -Example: "Hospital nurses waste 2 hours/day on manual paperwork" → Everyone prioritizes automation over aesthetics.
  -This reduces conflicts and rework from misaligned priorities.
5. Uncovers Hidden Needs by digging into "why" a problem exists reveals deeper pain points.
  -Example: "Clients complain about slow reports" → The real issue is lack of real-time data, not report speed.
  -Solutions address root causes, not symptoms.
6. Facilitates User-Centric Development by framing the problem from the user’s perspective (e.g., "As a teacher, I need to grade 100 papers/week") fuels empathy.
  -Example: A grading tool might prioritize bulk actions over individual feedback features.
  -This builds solutions users love, not just tolerate.
7. Reduces Risk of Failure:Validating the problem early (via interviews, data) ensures it’s worth solving.
  -Example: A "food delivery app for pets" might sound fun, but market research could show no demand.
  -Therefore avoids building something nobody wants.
   
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
+For example, I'd phtrase it:
  -"It’s like a command center for your team’s chaos.
Our software cuts through the noise of missed deadlines, confusing workflows, and endless status meetings. It brings everyone—developers, managers, and stakeholders—onto the same page, so projects move forward smoothly, bottlenecks get spotted before they cripple progress, and teams spend less time wrestling with tools and more time doing work that matters."

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
+Cost effective:clients are able to save money by knowin exactly what they are paying for and that it's not inflated unnecessarily.
+Transparency:Clients are able to pay for exactly what they can see from the generated report.
+Operational efficiency:from the report, clients are able to get a detailed report of their car service needs and ones which are crucial and none-crucial.
+Vehicle service followups:clients will get reminders forwhen their vehicles are due for service.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
+Key growth drivers
+Target market niche/segments
+competition landscape
+untapped opportunities
